 <p><mark></mar>Honeybees are vital pollinators that play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystems and supporting agriculture. These
social insects live in well-organized colonies consisting of a queen, worker bees, and drones. Worker bees are
responsible for foraging, producing honey, and maintaining the hive, while drones exist solely to mate with a queen.
Honeybees communicate through intricate dances, such as the waggle dance, to convey the location of food sources. Their
ability to produce honey from nectar not only sustains their colony but also provides humans with a natural sweetener
packed with health benefits. Unfortunately, honeybee populations are declining due to habitat loss, pesticides, and
climate change, making their conservation increasingly important for biodiversity and food security.</p>
